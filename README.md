# WebScraper-MOH-GOV-corona-cases

This is a Web Scraping script built using BeatifulSoup and hosted using Flask.
The repo includes both the jupyter notebook as well as the Python Script which stores the Statewise Corona Virus statistics from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ in a .txt file and overwrites everytime when executed to update the values in realtime.
